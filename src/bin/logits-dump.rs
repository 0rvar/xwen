//! Parity harness: feed raw token ids, run one forward pass, and dump the
//! final-position logits (plus, optionally, the per-layer intermediate taps) as
//! JSON for comparison against upstream llama.cpp.
//!
//! Two consumers read this JSON:
//!   * `scripts/parity.ts` cross-checks it against `llama-eval-callback` output
//!     (per-node sums + samples) to localize the first divergent layer. It maps
//!     our tap names onto llama.cpp's `cb()` node names — the mapping table is in
//!     docs/parity.md "Tap names", and the two name sets are NOT identical.
//!   * `tests/parity.rs` compares two of these dumps (candidate vs blessed
//!     reference) on the full logit vectors (cosine / top-1 / top-5).
//!
//! Schema (see `docs/parity.md` for the authoritative description):
