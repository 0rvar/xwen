//! Full-logit parity gate: compare two logits-dump JSON files (see
//! `src/bin/logits-dump.rs` for the schema) on the criteria that matter for
//! token-level equivalence.
//!
//! This is the dump-vs-dump track. It gates our engine against a blessed
//! reference dump in the SAME JSON format — either a previously blessed run of
//! our own engine (regression guard) or, in WP8, a reference produced from the
//! llama.cpp fork. The cross-implementation track (our dump vs the fork's
//! truncated eval-callback trace, which localizes the first divergent layer)
//! lives in `scripts/parity.ts`, because eval-callback does not expose full
//! logit vectors.
//!
//! Ignored by default (needs real dumps). Run once dumps exist, selecting the
//! tier that matches how the candidate was produced (see docs/parity.md §3b):
//!   XWEN_PARITY_DIR=/tmp/ref-code XWEN_PARITY_TIER=strict \
//!     cargo test --test parity -- --ignored --nocapture
//! The directory must contain `candidate.json` and `reference.json`.
//!
//! Two-tier gate (docs/parity.md §3b), both require identical input token ids
//! and top-5 overlap >= 4/5:
//!   * strict (default; mv_id/decode candidate): cosine >= COS_MIN_STRICT,
//!     top-1 match.
//!   * mm (mm_id prefill candidate): cosine >= COS_MIN_MM, and top-1 matches OR
//!     is a genuine near-tie — candidate's top-1 is the reference's top-1/top-2
//!     AND the reference's top-1/top-2 logit margin is < 0.5.
